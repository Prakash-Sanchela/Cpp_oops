// How map and hash map implemented internally
// How order is being maintained in map?
// How data is being stored actually in both map and hash map?
// How data conflicting handled in hash map?

1. Map -> red black tree
   hashmap -> hash tables
2. Order is being maintained using comparator operator and using red black tree where left side of element is less then the root.
