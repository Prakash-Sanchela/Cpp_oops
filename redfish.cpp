      - **Token-based Authentication**: Using tokens (e.g., OAuth) for more secure and flexible access management.

12. **What are Redfish roles and permissions?**
    - **Answer**: Redfish supports **role-based access control (RBAC)**, which means that users are assigned roles with specific permissions. Common roles include:
      - **Administrator**: Full access to manage and configure all resources.
      - **Operator**: Limited permissions to monitor and read data but not modify it.
      - **User**: Typically only read access with no ability to change configurations.
    - This helps control who can perform specific operations on hardware resources.

### **Advanced Redfish Concepts**

13. **How does Redfish support event handling and alerts?**
    - **Answer**: Redfish supports event handling through its **Event Service**.
